## About
[to be added]

## Contents
Thee next "graphic" shows the relations between the involved projects. The [SharkNet-Api-Android][1] currently not only uses the Android SharkFW but also inherits it due to some problems reagrding Android-Libraries depending on other Android-Libraries.  
**SharkNet**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  *uses*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v  
**[SharkNet-Api-Android][1]** => Maps the framework features to objects used in the SharkNet application  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  *uses*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v  
**Android SharkFW** => Adds Android functionalities like Wifi, Bluetooth, NFC, and GPS  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  *extends*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v  
**[SharkFW][2]** => The core framework!

## Prerequiries
This project requires the [SharkFW][2] and the [SharkNet-Api-Android][1] to work. The [SharkNet-Api-Android][1] is currently set as a git submodule and also as an Android-Library.

## Installation
Because all projects are developed simultaneously the [SharkFW][2] can not yet be accessed via a external repository. So the only way to us eit is to build it locally. Threfor you need to have **maven3** installed on your machine. After **maven3** is installed and the project was cloned to your local machine you can install it to your *local maven repository*. It is locaated in linux on `~/.m2`. Within the folder of the [SharkFW][2] project you need to execute the following maven command to install this project to your *local maven repository*. `mvn clean install`. This will load all the necessary dependencies and creates a .jar file with the complete framework. Once installed to your *local maven repository* the [SharkNet-Api-Android][1] can access this framework due to the settings made in *gradle*.
**BUT** there is still another thing to do. The [SharkNet-Api-Android][1] is used as an *Android-Library* and also as a *git submodule* so we need to retrieve the latest changes. Once you cloned [this][3] repository you have to inside the folder with `cd SharkNet` and initialize the submodules with the command `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`. This will initialize all submodules within this project (currently there is jsut one) and load all the data from the remote.

## Future Features
